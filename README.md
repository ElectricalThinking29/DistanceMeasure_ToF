# DistanceMeasure_ToF
This project is made to program a PC and an ESP32 to measure distance between 2 devices.

# Description
+ The "PC_MeasureDistanceToF" contains the Python script for a PC connects to an UDP Server,
send and receive messages, measures the Time of Fight (ToF) of the message and calculates
the distance.
+ The "ESP32_MeasureDistanceToF_AP" contains the programs for an ESP32 create an UDP Server, 
when receive a message, it will immediately send back to the Client that is connecting the
specified port.
+ Both project's programs were made on VS Code.

# Results and Reviews
+ Below is the result's data.
![Result2](result.jpg)
+ As you can see, the error is pretty large, from few to over 100 %. If we ignore the case
where the transmission's velocity is negative, the error is still go up to 50 %.
+ There are a number of issues that I think will improve measurement results:
  * Using more appropriate hardwares for measuring Time of Flight (ToF) of the message via WIfi
  * Using CSI data to get better timming
  * Improving the programs for better and faster reading
+ Even though I did this project just for fun and to satisfy my curiosity, I also don't mind listening
to your comments. If you want to ask questions, you can contact me at the address below.
